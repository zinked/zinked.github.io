[comment]: <> **Local Election Predictions - A Machine Learning Approach** <br>
[comment]: <> [Project website (in German)](https://www.wahlorakel.com/) <br>
[comment]: <> We explore the potential for machine learning algorithms to predict local election 
[comment]: <> outcomes. In order to do so, we collect micro-level data on candidates from 
[comment]: <> several sources. We use different prediction algorithms including neural networks 
[comment]: <> to train estimators based on past election results. 
[comment]: <> Then, we apply these estimator to the current candidate lists to 
[comment]: <> predict results of upcoming elections. So far, we publicly covered three 
[comment]: <> local elections in Bavaria (March 2020), North Rhine-Westphalia (September 2020), 
[comment]: <> Hesse (March 2021), and one mayoral election in Stuttgart (November 2020).
