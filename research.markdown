  Policies targeting disadvantaged areas aim to improve their conditions, but the labels they impose carry consequences of their own. In this paper, we examine Denmark's Ghetto Plan, one of the first recent place-based policies explicitly targeting migrant populations. Under this policy, certain public housing deemed ``problematic'' were officially designated as ``ghettos'', with minimal additional implications. Using rich administrative data and a Difference-in-Differences approach, we show that the policy backfired, worsening spatial inequality through compositional shifts driven by native avoidance. In addition, the policy was particularly detrimental to exposed natives, who accepted a 4% annual income loss to leave stigmatized areas.

**PTSD and Refugees' Underemployment -- Evidence from People Displaced from Ukraine** <br>

  Refugee integration remains a major policy challenge in many host countries. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), resulting from exposure to war and violence, may affect refugees’ integration. Using survey data representative of an entire cohort of refugees -- collected shortly after arrival and linked to administrative tax records -- we quantify the PTSD employment gap. PTSD symptoms are associated with substantially lower employment probabilities, accounting for roughly a quarter of the overall refugee-native employment gap two years after arrival. These findings underscore the economic relevance of trauma and suggest that psychological support may complement existing integration policies.

**After Autocracy - Tunisia After the Arab Uprisings** <br>

<details>
  <summary>ABSTRACT</summary>
  <div style="font-size: 12px;">
  What happens to the existing balance of political power when autocrats leave? I study the territorial redistribution of political power in Tunisia after the Arab Uprisings, four weeks of mass protests forced the president of 24 years to step down, setting Tunisia off on a transition out of autocracy. Political decentralization was an important part of the new constitution a Constituent Assembly elected in October 2011 started to draft. But municipal elections were not held until May 2018. In these seven years, the central government appointed, and replaced municipal councils by decree. I generate a novel data set on these council appointments from regulative texts and exploit variation across regions and over time to quantify the power struggles that arose between civil society seeking greater autonomy and the state trying to establish larger territorial reach. I find that appointments led to more violent conflict. This conflict was driven by repeated replacements of previously appointed councils. Event studies support the idea that violent conflict was indeed a reaction to council appointments and not vice versa.

**Motivations for Female Political Representation - Perceptions and Preferences from Tanzania** <br>
*with  Pablo Selaya (UCPH), and Sina Smid (CBS)* <br>

  <summary>ABSTRACT</summary>
  <div style="font-size: 12px;">
  Why do people want more women in politics? While women’s numeric representation has increased globally, it remains unclear how the public perceives its connection to substantive policy influence. This paper examines public preferences regarding the relationship between numeric and substantive representation in Tanzania—a pioneer in institutionalized gender quotas. Using original survey data, including survey experiments conducted at the University of Dar es Salaam across three time points (2020–2021), we develop a novel and robust measure of these preferences. Our findings show that support for increased female political representation is primarily driven by a desire for greater substantive representation. Respondents who express this motivation are significantly more likely to perceive that female candidates face higher standards in politics. Moreover, the gap between preferred and perceived levels of representation serves as a meaningful indicator of demand for gender equality, but not with support for Tanzania's current gender quota. We find that respondents generally favor affirmative action policies aimed at equality of opportunity over equality of outcome.
