**Local Election Predictions - A Machine Learning Approach** <br>
[Project website (in German)](https://www.wahlorakel.com/) <br>
We explore the potential for machine learning algorithms to predict local election 
outcomes. In order to do so, we collect micro-level data on candidates from 
several sources. We use different prediction algorithms including neural networks 
to train estimators based on past election results. 
Then, we apply these estimator to the current candidate lists to 
predict results of upcoming elections. So far, we publicly covered three 
local elections in Bavaria (March 2020), North Rhine-Westphalia (September 2020), 
Hesse (March 2021), and one mayoral election in Stuttgart (November 2020).
