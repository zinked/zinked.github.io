I am a PhD candidate at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.economics.ku.dk/staff/phd_kopi/?pure=en/persons/594488). 
I am an applied microeconomist working on the political economy of social exclusion. More broadly, I am interested in how
cultural and institutional change interact with economic outcomes.
