I am a political economist studying social exclusion and currently employed as a Post-Doc at the <a href="https://www.economics.ku.dk/">Department of Economics, University of Copenhagen</a>. <br>
My most recent work is focused on Ukrainian refugees in Denmark.
Previously, I have studied political participation of women in Tanzania, redistribution of political power in Tunisia
after the Arab Uprisings, and evaluated Denmarkâ€™s public housing policies. Methodologically, I am an applied microeconometrician.
I have worked with Danish register data, collected my own survey data, web-scraped and analyzed text
data. My future work will continue to explore the assimilation and integration of marginalized or excluded groups in Western societies.
