    I am a political economist studying social exclusion and currently employed as a Post-Doc at the <a href="https://www.economics.ku.dk/">Department of Economics, University of Copenhagen</a>. <br>
    My PhD was on the political economy of social exclusion, with case studies in Tunisia, Tanzania, and Denmark. 
	As a post-doc, I have since successfully developed this research, in an interdisciplinary approach with political scientists and psychologists, 
	to study the social and economic integration of Ukrainian refugees in Denmark. 
	In the future, I want to continue to contribute to a better understanding of the social fabric of our societies, with a focus on immigrant integration in Europe.
